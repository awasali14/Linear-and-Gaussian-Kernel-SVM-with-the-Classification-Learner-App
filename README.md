# Linear-and-Gaussian-Kernel-SVM-with-the-Classification-Learner-App

## Project Description

This repository contains code for performing classification using a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The code demonstrates how to load the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the decision boundary.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to showcase the implementation of a Linear SVM model for classification tasks. By providing a step-by-step guide, users can understand how to apply the SVM algorithm to their own datasets and gain insights into the decision-making process of the model.

## Problem Solving

The project addresses the problem of binary classification by utilizing a Linear SVM model. It aims to separate data points from two classes based on their features. The decision boundary generated by the model allows for distinguishing between the classes and predicting the class labels of new, unseen data points.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following learning outcomes are achieved:

1. Familiarity with the Classification Learner app in MATLAB: The project introduces the Classification Learner app, a powerful tool for training, evaluating, and visualizing classification models.

2. Understanding the process of training a Linear SVM model: The code demonstrates how to select and train a Linear SVM model using the available data. It also highlights the importance of data normalization in model training.

3. Evaluation of model performance: The project showcases various evaluation techniques, including scatter plots, confusion matrices, and summary statistics, to assess the performance of the trained model.

4. Visualizing decision boundaries: The code includes a function, `decisionBoundary`, which plots the decision boundary of the Linear SVM model along with the input data points. This visualization aids in understanding how the model separates the classes.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset: The code starts by loading the dataset (`data1.mat`) using the `load` function and storing it in the `data` variable.

2. Training the model: The Classification Learner app is utilized to train the model. Users are guided to open the app, select the predictor and response variables, start a new session, and choose the dataset (`data`). The default model is 'Fine Tree', but users are instructed to switch to 'Linear SVM' from the 'Support Vector Machines' list. The model is automatically trained after selection, and data normalization is applied.

3. Evaluating the model: The trained model's performance can be evaluated using various options available in the Classification Learner app. These include the 'Scatter Plot' to visualize misclassified objects, the 'Confusion Matrix' plot to analyze correct and incorrect predictions by class, and the 'Current Model' pane for summary statistics.

4. Exporting the model: Once satisfied with the model's performance, users can export it to the workspace by selecting 'Export Model -> Export Model' in the app. The default output variable name is 'trainedModel', which is used in the subsequent code.

5. Generating decision boundary plot: The code utilizes the `decisionBoundary` function to plot the decision boundary of the trained Linear SVM model. The function takes the trained model (`mdl`), input feature matrix (`X`), and corresponding class labels (`y`) as input.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive guide to perform classification using a Linear SVM model. By following the steps outlined in the code and utilizing the Classification Learner app, users can gain insights into the implementation, evaluation, and visualization aspects of the model. The inclusion of the `decisionBoundary` function enhances the understanding of how the model separates the classes. Through this project, users can apply the knowledge gained to their own classification tasks and make informed decisions based on the model's predictions.

**Note:** The code assumes the dataset `data1.mat` is available and correctly formatted.
